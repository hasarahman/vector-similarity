# Vector Similarity
This notebook guides you through using Neon Serverless Postgres as a vector database for OpenAI embeddings. It demonstrates how to:

1. Use embeddings created by OpenAI API.
   
2. Store embeddings in a Neon Serverless Postgres database.
   
3. Convert a raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.
   
4. Use Neon with the pgvector extension to perform vector similarity search.
